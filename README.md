## File Renaming Utility

This utility provides a Python function to rename all files in a specified directory. It particularly matches a specific
pattern in filenames and modifies them accordingly. 

For more details on its usage, caveats, and other important information, please refer to the specific readme file for 
this utility [here](./file_renaming/readme.md).

Please remember to carefully review the usage guidelines and caveats before using any of these scripts. Always back up 
your data before running any scripts that modify it. 


# TODO
1. Make this readme useful.
2. Refactor project structure
